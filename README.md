# Instacart_Python_Project_Achievement-

Instacart, an online grocery store that operates through an app. It operates a grocery delivery and pick-up service. Instacart already has very good sales, but they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. 

## Objective

My task is to perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria. The idea is to learn about a variety of customers at Instacart and their purchasing behaviors to develop a targeted marketing strategy.

## Data

Customer's information dataset provided for me:

- Orders
- Products
- Orders_Products_Prior
- Customers
- Departments

  ## Folders

  The basket analysis was arranged into the following folders:

- Project Management: Project Brief
- Data (Data files not uploaded to GitHub due to size.)
- Scripts: The Jupyter notebooks containing the coding for the analysis.
- Analysis: The visualizations used for developing and explaining insights.
- Sent to Client: The final report presented in Excel

  ## Terminology

- script = notebook
- variable = column = characteristic
- observation = entry
- dataset = dataframe = df
- read = import
- run = execute
- write = export = save
- derive a variable = create a column
- filter = subset
- merge flag = match flag
- key column = identifier column
